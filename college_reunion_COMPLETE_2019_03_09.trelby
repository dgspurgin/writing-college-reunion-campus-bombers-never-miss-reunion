>:No. I've got a problem with Colby,

.:Second!
..Tuggy is startled by enthusiasm of response.
._Tuggy
>:I already have my degree, so you
.:can't kick me out, people.
._Dean McCracken
>:That's true. You do, amazingly,
>:have a Colby degree. But, according
>:to the alumni bylaws, a class does
>:have the right to remove a member
>:with a 2/3rds majority vote. Let's
>:find out if 2/3rds of your class
.:hates you, shall we, Arthur?
._Tuggy
.:Why are you guys listening to her?

>:I think it's because you threw

>:That girl was right. I'm not part

>:You disappeared. I had no idea you

.:I know you're not, Tuggy.
._Tuggy
>:I just feel like everyone else

.:Tuggy, you're not a total failure.

>:Percy, life isn't just a medical

._Percy
>:I ran away from home didn't I? I
>:went streaking. I stole a lobster

>:be? It's not my fault people can't
.:see me.
._Craig's Ghost
.:Are you sure about that?
._Percy
.:What else could I possibly do?
._Craig's Ghost
>:You could move out of your mom's

._Percy
.:I just told you. I ran away.
._Craig's Ghost
>:And where are you going when

._Percy
.:I'd don't know. Somewhere.
._Craig's Ghost
>:You're going back to your mom's

._Percy
.:Maybe not.

.:Percy! Get up!
._Percy
>:I'm gonna lie here until someone
>:doesn't see me and runs me over.
>:Then we can get on with this whole

>:Percy, you don't wanna become a

>:I'm not even good at killing

._Craig's Ghost
>:Don't you get it? He swerved! That

._Percy
.:Someone saw me? 
..Percy stands up, returns to curb.
._Tuggy

._Percy
.:That was John Robbins?

.:Tuggy no more jokes.
._Tuggy
.:Eric, I'm not joking.
._Eric
.:Tuggy--
._Tuggy
.:I'm not joking!
._Eric
.:Okay. I believe you.
._Tuggy
>:I've seen him scoping out campus
>:all weekend. What if he's planning
>:to blow up the math building
.:again?!
._Eric
.:So let him.
._Tuggy
.:What?! Our class is in there!
._Eric
>:Tuggy, they just voted us out of
>:the class. They told us we're not
>:part of their family anymore so
>:we're not part of their family.
.:It's not our problem.
._Tuggy
>:Eric, I know you're mad at me
.:but---
._Eric
>:Tuggy, I'm not mad at you. And I'm
>:not mad at our class. I'm mad at
.:myself. I can't believe I...
.((looks down at self)
.:Let this happen.
._Tuggy
.:McCracken did that to you.
._Eric
>:She helped but the truth is I did
.:this to myself. 
._Tuggy
>:Eric being homeless isn't your
>:fault. People take way too much
>:credit for their successes and
>:failures. Some people just get
>:lucky. They end up in boardrooms
>:while the rest of us get stuck in
.:quicksand.
._Eric
.:Right. Rule #2.
._Tuggy
>:Now, I know they just kicked us out
>:but honestly, they should have. I
>:deserved it. I've been pretty
.:annoying this weekend.
._Eric
.:Who you?
._Tuggy
>:But they're still our friends,
>:Eric. Some dumb vote doesn't change
>:that. And when people you love are
>:about to get blown up you rescue
>:them. Even if they throw you in
.:jail afterwards.
._Eric
.:Fine. How are we gonna do this?
..Tuggy snaps fingers, pulls out phone.
._Craig's Ghost
>:There's hope for you yet, Percy. Of
>:course that hope's based on a guy
.:who's about to blow up your class.
._Percy
.:John wouldn't blow up anyone.
._Craig's Ghost
.:Tell them, not me.
._Tuggy
.((deep voice)
>:I'd like to report a bomb threat in

.((normal voice)
>:Okay. It's Tuggy. Look! I just saw
>:The Campus Bomber! He's driving
>:towards the math building and our
>:classmates... Hello? They hung up!
.:I'll call Ted.
._Eric
>:I'm not sure we've built up quite
>:enough credibility to get Ted or
.:anyone else to listen to us, Tug.
._Tuggy
>:Fine. Then I'll go up there and
.:pull the fire alarm.
._Eric
>:Let's review. We don't have a way
>:to get to campus. If we could get
>:to campus they'd throw us in jail.
>:And if by some miracle we could get
>:all the way to the math building
>:and near a fire alarm, we wouldn't
>:be able to set it off because it's
>:deactivated from the last time you
.:had this idea 30 minutes ago. 
._Tuggy
>:Admittedly there's a few kinks to
.:work out.
._Eric
>:Tuggy, I don't see how we're gonna
.:get everybody out of there.
._Tuggy
>:Then we gotta stop The Campus
>:Bomber from getting there in the
.:first place.
._Eric
>:What?! Us?! Stop that psycho?! And
>:remember? No way to get to campus.
.:Jail if we get caught.
._Percy
.:Excuse me. 
._Tuggy
.:Trust me. I've got a plan.

.:Where'd you come from? 
._Percy
.:It's a long story.
._Tuggy

._Tuggy

._Percy
.:How'd you get down here?
._Tuggy
.:Touche.

>:Well we better figure something out

._Percy
.:You don't know he has a bomb.
._Eric
>:You don't know he doesn't have a

._Tuggy
>:Either way we've got to get up

._Percy
.:Can we call a taxi?
._Eric
>:In Waterville, Maine? It's only 3

._Tuggy
>:We'll rush the van. We can use

._Eric
>:You want us to take out a deadly

._PERCY
.:He's not deadly.
._Tuggy
>:Of course we'll draw him out into
